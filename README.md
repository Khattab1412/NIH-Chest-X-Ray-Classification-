# Dataset
The ChestX-ray14 dataset consists of 112,120 frontal chest X-ray images from 30,805 unique patients, annotated with 14 disease labels. To ensure rigorous evaluation, we divided the dataset into training (70%), validation (10%), and test (20%) sets based on patient IDs, preventing any overlap between these subsets.
